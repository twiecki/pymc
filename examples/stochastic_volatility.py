# Asset prices have time-varying volatility (variance of day over day
#`returns`). In some periods, returns are highly vaiable, and in
# others very stable. Stochastic volatility models model this with a
# latent volatility variable, modeled as a stochastic process. The
# following model is similar to the one described in the No-U-Turn
# Sampler paper, Hoffman (2011) p21.
#
# $$ \sigma \sim Exponential(50) $$
#
# $$ \nu \sim Exponential(.1) $$
#
# $$ s_i \sim Normal(s_{i-1}, \sigma^{-2}) $$
#
# $$ log(\frac{y_i}{y_{i-1}}) \sim t(\nu, 0, exp(-2 s_i)) $$
#
# Here, $y$ is the daily return series and $s$ is the latent volatility process.

# Build Model
# --------------

# <codecell>

model = Model()
Var = model.Var
Data = model.Data

# <markdowncell>

# Its easier to sample the scale of the volatility process innovations on a log scale, so we use `TransformedVar`.

# <codecell>

sigma, log_sigma = model.TransformedVar('sigma', Exponential(1./.02),
                 logtransform, testval = -2.5)

nu = Var('nu', Exponential(1./10))

n = 400
s = Var('s', GaussianRandomWalk(sigma**-2), shape = n)

returns = np.genfromtxt("data/SP500.csv")[-n:]

Data(returns, T(nu, lam = exp(-2*s)))

# Fit Model ------------ To get a decent scale for the hamiltonaian
# sampler, we find the hessian at a point. However, the 2nd
# derivatives for the degrees of freedom are negative and thus not
# very informative, so we make an educated guess. The interactions
# between `log_sigma`/`nu` and `s` are also not very useful, so we set
# them to zero.
#
# The hessian matrix is also very sparse, so we make it a sparse matrix for faster sampling.

# <codecell>

H = model.d2logpc()

def hessian(point, nusd):
    h = H(point)
    h[1,1] = nusd**-2
    h[:2,2:] = h[2:,:2] = 0

    return csc_matrix(h)

# The full MAP is a degenerate case wrt to sd and nu, so we find the MAP wrt the volatility process, keeping log_sd and nu constant at their default values. We use l_bfgs_b because it is more efficient for high dimensional functions (`s` has n elements)

# <codecell>

start = find_MAP(model, vars = [s], fmin = optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b)

# <markdowncell>

# We do a short initial run to get near the right area, then start again using a new hessian at the new starting point.

# <codecell>

step = HamiltonianMC(model, model.vars, hessian(start, 6))
trace, _,t = sample(200, step, start)

start2 = trace.point(-1)
step = HamiltonianMC(model, model.vars, hessian(start2, 6), path_length = 4.)
trace, _,t = sample(8000, step, trace = trace)

# <codecell>

#figsize(12,6)

plt.plot(trace[s][::10].T,'b', alpha = .01);
